This repo contains code for a python script simulating devices that send telemetry data to an Azure IoT hub using the MQTT protocol.

Here there is a link to a tutorial on how to build an architecture like this, composed by the python script that simulates the two devices, Azure Iot Hub, the web app that acts as a public dashboard to see the traffic of data, and cosmosDb to implement the persistence layer:

There is also short video, available at this link below, in which it is possible to see this simple system in action:
