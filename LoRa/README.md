# Send telemetry data through LoRa using St-Lrwan1 devices and the things network

This is the folder for the third assignment of the iot class. The goal of this assignment was to built on-top of the cloud-based and edge-based components developed in the first and second assignments a system that retrieves telemery data from sensors. Now we will replace the MQTT protocol and the short-range wireless medium with LoRaWAN and TheThingsNetwork. In this assignment we will develop a new RIOT-OS application that will be executed on the B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRa kit. We will use TheThingsNetwork to interconnect the sensor devices with the cloud infrastructure via the MQTT protocol.

Here you can find a guide that will help you developing a sysem like this:
